## Overview

This project uses artificial intelligence to classify memes based on their content. It combines information from the image and any text in the meme to predict its category.

## Features

- **Upload a Meme**: Submit your meme to see if itâ€™s positive or negative.

- **Quick Results**: Get instant feedback from our AI-powered model.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use, even if you're not familiar with technology.


## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Add your meme image and the system will process it.

2. **AI Analysis**: The model looks at both the image and text.

3. **Result**: It predicts whether the meme has a positive or negative vibe.


## Deployment

- **Website**: You can access the meme classifier through a simple web app.

- **Behind the Scenes**:

    - An advanced AI model analyzes the memes.

    - Everything is hosted securely on Google Cloud.

    - Built using technologies like Docker for smooth operation.
